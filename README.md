Subtle is an extensible voice-to-text subtitler that enables users seamless communication even when video chat is spotty.

##Motivation

* Makes it more accessible for deaf individuals to video chat
* Alleviates hardware that falls short of its intended purpose (ie. microphone capability)


## todo
* look into chrome extensions
* look into other platforms
* look into potential languages
* look into relevant apis (youtube subtitle service thing, I'm looking at you)
* learn how to format README.md docs
